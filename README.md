This is a prototype of Concerto Web Editor for developer and non developer. Developer can write and modify code directly on Code Editor. For non-developer he has to drag and drop classes and define relationship between nodes using customized arrow links. We have the main component where we can drag and drop the class node and at the bottom, dynamically code will be generated.
